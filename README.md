# Lindenmayer_Systems_biology
Course Project 2 for Theory of Computing

This project demonstrates L-Systems, their relation to formal language theory, and their impact on the study of developmental biology. For this project, I wrote programs to demonstrate how L-Systems work similarly to context-free grammars and to show how they can be used to create computer graphics. This programming was done in Python3 using Turtle Graphics and can be viewed easily in the Jupyter iPython Notebook.
